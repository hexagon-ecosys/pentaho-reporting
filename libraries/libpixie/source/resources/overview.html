<p>
  The pixie library is a fork of the original gnu.bhresearch.pixie library. It
  only purpose is to add vector graphics support to JFreeReport. At the moment,
  this library contains code to read most wmf-files.
</p>

<p>
  The wmf-code supports most options of the Windows 3.1 WMF-specififcations.
  Palette animation or OLE embedding is not supported.
</p>

<p>
  FloodFill is also not implemented as the Graphics2D implementation is not
  pixel-based.Simple embedded bitmaps should work, but most BitBlt operations
  are unsupported. BitBlt Operations are bitmap-based operations and will not be
  supported by this library.
